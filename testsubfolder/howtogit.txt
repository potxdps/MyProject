1. Create file with sublime or something similar (some files may not send through Git)
2. Place file in repo (C:\cygwin64\home\PO18352\MyProject)
3. If subfolder is needed, place there.
4. Open Cygwin Terminal
5. Type cd ~/MyProject/subfoldername
6. Need to tell the terminal about the file. Type git add filename.ext  
7. Now the terminal knows about the file, tracks the file.
8. To commit it, type git commit -m filename.ext . This does not move it, it prepares it.
9. To actually upload it, type git push origin master . This physically moves/uploads the file.
10. Note: if updating a file you don’t need to add, if the name is same, replace in local repo and commit and push again to move.
